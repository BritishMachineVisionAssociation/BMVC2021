## Postdoc position on deep learning for online 3D scene understanding from images - (2000002K)

The Pattern Analysis and Computer Vision (PAVIS) research line at IIT invites qualified applicants to submit their CV’s for a Postdoc position in Genoa under the supervision of Dr. Alessio Del Bue.

PAVIS research line is actively developing an Artificial Intelligence (AI) infrastructure to understand our physical space and the human behaviors within it. The focus of the group is on creating intelligent systems that jointly accomplish two main goals:

- Spatial AI: Perceive and understand autonomously the real physical world, both static and dynamic, with its corresponding spatial semantic (where are things, what is their function, which is the dynamic of the scene).
- Social AI: Perceive and understand humans and their behaviors as observed by cameras in relation to the physical spaces they are interacting with.

This open position, up to two years, is financed in the context of the H2020 European Project MEMEX (MEMories and EXperiences for inclusive digital storytelling – Grant Agreement 870743 - https://www.memexproject.eu) – an interdisciplinary effort to provide Augmented Reality (AR) systems to impact the European society at large.

The candidate will have the opportunity to work on realistic problems involving leading European research centers and companies with the aim to create a novel AR platform able to understand the semantic scene structure of the environment using an RGB video stream from a smartphone.

The research topics on 3D scene understanding are related to the recent PAVIS achievements on Spatial AI related to 3D semantic mapping, object 3D localization, graph neural networks (GNNs) for scene modelling and active visual reasoning by integrating deep learning models with multi-view geometry approaches. Such methods will leverage massive worldwide geolocalised data as provided by project partners to finally deploy a mobile app that understands, localizes and reason about the semantic elements present in a generic scene.

A relevant scientific track record on major computer vision conferences/journals (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, TPAMI, IJCV, etc.) is a criteria for the selection as well as experience on DNN models and in particular related to GNN. Experience on multi-view geometry is considered a plus for this position.

At the time of the application, eligible candidates should have a Ph.D. degree in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Robotics or related fields. The successful candidate will be offered a competitive salary commensurate to qualifications and experience.

Please submit your application using the online form including a detailed curriculum vitae with publication list brief description of research interests and main accomplishments and names and contacts of 2 referees.

The call will remain open until the position is filled but a first deadline for evaluation of candidates will be September 30, 2020. The position will be approved pending signature of the grant agreement by the European Commission.
