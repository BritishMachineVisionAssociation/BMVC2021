abstract: "Standard supervised learning setting assumes that training data and test data come from the same distribution (domain). Domain generalization (DG) methods try to learn a model that when trained on data from multiple domains, would generalize to a new unseen domain. We extend DG to an even more challenging setting, where the label space of the unseen domain could also change. We introduce this problem as Zero-Shot Domain Generalization (to the best of our knowledge, the first such effort), where the model generalizes across new domains and also across new classes in those domains.
We propose a simple strategy which effectively exploits semantic information of classes, to adapt existing DG methods to meet the demands of Zero-Shot Domain Generalization. We evaluate the proposed methods on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, F-MNIST and PACS datasets; establishing a strong baseline to foster interest in this new research direction."
