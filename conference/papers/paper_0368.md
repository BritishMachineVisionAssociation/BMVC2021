abstract: "Object detection is a popular branch of research in computer vision, many state of the art object detection algorithms have been introduced in the recent past, but how good are  those object detectors when it comes to dense object detection? In this paper we review common and highly accurate object detection methods on the scenes where numerous similar looking objects are placed in close proximity with each other.  We also show that, multi-task learning of gaussian maps along with classification and bounding box regression gives us a significant boost in accuracy over the baseline. We introduce Gaussian Layer and Gaussian Decoder in the existing RetinaNet network for better accuracy in dense scenes, with the same computational cost as the RetinaNet. We show the gain of 6% and 5% in mAP with respect to baseline RetinaNet.
Our method also achieves the state of the art accuracy on the SKU110K  dataset.
