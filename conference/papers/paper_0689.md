abstract: "We present a novel Bipartite Graph Reasoning GAN (BiGraphGAN) for the challenging person image generation task. The proposed graph generator mainly consists of two novel blocks that aim to model the pose-to-pose and pose-to-image relations, respectively. Specifically, the proposed Bipartite Graph Reasoning (BGR) block aims to reason the crossing long-range relations between the source pose and the target pose in a bipartite graph, which mitigates some challenges caused by pose deformation. Moreover, we propose a new Interaction-and-Aggregation (IA) block to effectively update and enhance the feature representation capability of both person's shape and appearance in an interactive way. Experiments on two challenging and public datasets,~emph{i.e.},~Market-1501 and DeepFashion, show the effectiveness of the proposed BiGraphGAN in terms of objective quantitative scores and subjective visual realness.
The source code and trained models are available at https://github.com/Ha0Tang/BiGraphGAN."
