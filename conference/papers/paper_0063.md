abstract: "This paper contributes a novel cognitively-inspired method for RGB-D indoor scene classification. High intra-class variance and low inter-class variance makes indoor scene classification an extremely challenging task. To cope with this problem, we propose a clustering approach inspired by the concept learning model of the hippocampus and the neocortex, to generate clusters and centroids for different scene categories. Test images depicting different scenes are classified by using their distance to the closest centroids (concepts). Modeling of RGB-D scenes as centroids not only leads to state-of-the-art classification performance on benchmark datasets (SUN RGB-D and NYU Depth V2), but also offers a method for inspecting and interpreting the space of centroids. Inspection of the centroids generated by our approach on RGB-D datasets leads us to propose a method for merging conceptually similar categories, resulting in improved accuracy for all approaches."
