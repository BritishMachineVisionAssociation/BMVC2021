abstract: "3D scene reconstruction from multiple views is an important classical problem in computer vision. Deep learning based approaches have recently demonstrated impressive reconstruction results. When training such models, self-supervised methods are favourable since they do not rely on ground truth data which would be needed for supervised training and is often difficult to obtain. Moreover, learned multi-view stereo reconstruction is prone to environment changes and should robustly generalise to different domains. We propose an adaptive learning approach for multi-view stereo which trains a deep neural network for improved adaptability to new target domains. We use model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to train base parameters which, in turn, are adapted for multi-view stereo on new domains through self-supervised training. Our evaluations demonstrate that the proposed adaptation method is effective in learning self-supervised multi-view stereo reconstruction in new domains."
