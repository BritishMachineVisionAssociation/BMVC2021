abstract: "Person search is the task of retrieving a pedestrian image given a list of text attributes. We investigate a novel mechanism that operates in feature embedding space for matching data across visual and text modalities. We propose a framework (TAVD) with two complementary modules: Text attribute feature aggregation (TA) that aggregates multiple semantic attributes in a bimodal space for globally matching text descriptions with images and Visual feature decomposition (VD) which performs feature embedding for locally matching image regions with text attributes. The results and comparisons to the state of the art on three standard benchmarks demonstrate that our solution is an effective strategy for retrieving person images while retaining the semantic of each query text attribute."
