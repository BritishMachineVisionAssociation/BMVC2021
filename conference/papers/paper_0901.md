abstract: " Geodesic regression has been proposed for fitting the geodesic curve. However, it cannot automatically choose the dimensionality of data. In this paper, we develop a Bayesian geodesic regression model on Riemannian manifolds (BGRM) model. To avoid the overfitting problem, we add a regularization term to control the effectiveness of the model. To automatically select the dimensionality, we develop a prior for the geodesic regression model, which can automatically select the number of relevant dimensions by driving unnecessary tangent vectors to zero. To show the validation of our model, we first apply it in the 3D synthetic sphere and 2D pentagon data. We then demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in reducing the dimensionality and analyzing shape variations of human corpus callosum and mandible data."
