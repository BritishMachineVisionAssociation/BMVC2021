abstract: "To have a better understanding and usage of Convolution Neural Networks (CNNs), the visualization and interpretation of CNNs has attracted increasing attention in recent years. In particular, several Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods have been proposed to discover the connection between CNN's decision and image regions. However, in spite of the reasonable visualization, most of these methods lack clear and sufficient theoretical support. In this paper, we introduce two axioms -- Sensitivity and Conservation -- to the visualization paradigm of the CAM methods. Meanwhile, a dedicated Axiom-based Grad-CAM (XGrad-CAM) is proposed to satisfy these axioms as much as possible. Experiments demonstrate that XGrad-CAM is an enhanced version of Grad-CAM in terms of sensitivity and conservation. It is able to achieve better visualization performance than Grad-CAM, while also be class-discriminative and easy-to-implement compared with Grad-CAM++ and Ablation-CAM. Code is available at https://github.com/Fu0511/XGrad-CAM."
