abstract: "We propose a unified representation learning framework to address the Cross Model Compatibility (CMC) problem in the context of visual search applications. Cross-compatibility between different embedding models enables the visual search systems to correctly recognize and retrieve identities without re-encoding user images, which are usually not available due to privacy concerns. While there are existing approaches to address CMC in face identification, they fail to work in a more challenging setting where the distributions of embedding models shift drastically. The proposed solution improves CMC performance by introducing a light-weight Residual Bottleneck Transformation (RBT) module and a new training scheme to optimize the embedding spaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed solution outperforms previous approaches by a large margin for various challenging visual search scenarios of face recognition and person re-identification.
