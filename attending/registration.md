Registration for the virtual conference is now open. 
There are two options for registration: for accepted papers, there is a conference an event enabling registration fee of Â£42 to cover the server hosting for the videos and interactive content and fixed costs that we have tried to keep as low as possible to allow BMVC to go ahead. We require one of these fees to be paid <strong>per paper</strong> but it also includes a single registration for one of the authors. For the remaining authors and other attendees, <strong>registration is free</strong> to allow as many people as possible to attend the interactive parts of the virtual conference.

<!--
### Bursaries

We have 20 free bursary places available for students who would otherwise be unable to meet the costs of attending the virtual conference. If you would like to apply for a bursary please fill in the form [here](https://forms.gle/zhmYCWfRPckEFx2e8) which will also ask for proof of your student status. Unfortunately, we cannot accept a bursary registration in place of the per paper event enabling fee.
