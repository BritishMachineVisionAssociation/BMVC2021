## BMVA Mailshots

There are four regular mailshots each year to send out [BMVA News](/bmva-news/) (typically
early Jan, early April, early July, early October). These will also include
any calls or programmes for forthcoming workshops.  Additional inclusions in
newsletter mailshots can either be academic or commercial; the [BMVA News](/bmva-news/)
editor can agree to additional academic inclusions but please contact
[the Chairman](mailto:chair@bmva.org) regarding any additional commercial
inclusions.
